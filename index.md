I recently bought a 1971 four level split and in HDTV style, I have named it the "Hamburglar House". Most of the house was in orginal condition. I gutted the house.... then COVID happened... so I did a lot of the work on the house myself with some help from my Mom and Friends. Here are my some of my renovation adventures!
